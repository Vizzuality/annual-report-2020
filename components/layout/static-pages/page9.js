        <p>2020 marked a quiet, but no less important turning point for climate change progress. </p>
        <p>Thanks to a combination of private ingenuity, government intervention, and the work of dedicated scientists and engineers, the market forces that once resisted climate action are now pulling us away from coal and gas. Renewable energy became cheaper than fossil fuels across most of the world, and solar and wind energy prices continue to drop.</p>
        <p>Political will is changing too. Support for climate change regulation is at a record high in the US. The Biden Administration has named climate a top priority and rejoined the Paris Agreement. Europe has adopted a Green Deal, and China has raised its environmental ambitions.</p>

        <p>In the business world, a growing number of corporations have made commitments to reduce or eliminate their climate impacts.</p>
        <h2>A sustainable future which for so long felt like an uphill battle now looks inevitable. It’s just a matter of how fast we move.</h2>
        <p>But, there remains an enormous amount of work to be done. Commitments must be turned into action, entire economic sectors must evolve, and policies to accelerate progress and regulations to limit polluters are still necessary. We also have a moral obligation to help those hit hardest by stronger storms, deeper droughts, rising seas, and the economic churn of progress. And yet, despite the adversity before us, I feel the hope of inevitability.</p>
        <p>Working together — as one global community — I believe we can make a greener future happen a little bit faster. Join me. </p>
