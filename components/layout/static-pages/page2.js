        <p>One of them was the addition of almost real-time fire alert data and analysis to Global Forest Watch. The update arrived in time to track the record-breaking USA wildfires. Visitors to the platform could see which states were worst affected, and see if the number of fire alerts in those places was higher than normal. (Spoiler alert, the number of fire alerts in California and Oregon was unusually high in September 2020).</p>
        <p>We also worked with the Half-Earth Project and Map of Life to publish a new approach to evaluating the level of protection species receive in any given country. The method — which has been called the Species Protection Index — will help guide a global strategy of biodiversity conservation. </p>
