      <h2>We have seen it for ourselves.</h2>
      <p>We saw how <a className="-strong -underline" href="https://medium.com/vizzuality-blog/a-map-with-impact-8aa991a727fe" target="_blank">Global Fishing Watch</a> data helped convince Argentina’s government to create two Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The addition of these MPAs increased the area of protection from 3% to 9%. </p>

      <p>We saw how GLAD alerts on <a className="-strong -underline" href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/data-and-research/glad-alerts-reduce-deforestation-africa/" target="_blank">Global Forest Watch</a> detected illegal deforestation in Peru and helped hold a cacao company to account.</p>
      <p>We saw how the <a className="-strong -underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/leading-burger-supplier-sourced-from-amazon-farmer-guilty-of-deforestation" target="_blank">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/leading-burger-supplier-sourced-from-amazon-farmer-guilty-of-deforestation" target="_blank">Trase</a> data to make consumers more aware of the links between deforestation in the Amazon and the burgers sold by fast-food restaurants.</p>

      <p className="-caption">Trase helped flag inconsistent zero-deforestation-commitment reports in beef exports from the Amazon Rainforest to the UK, even when these represented a minimal proportion of the total production.</p>
      <p>But we want more change to happen. That’s why we started working with one of the world’s largest international food and beverage companies who wants to calculate the environmental impact of procuring raw materials in their supply chain. We also secured funding from the European Union to develop supply chain management tools for the food industry. These tools will include traceability, impact calculation, and risk forecasting using Copernicus data.</p>
      <h2>In 2020, we turned our attention to unlocking the potential of supply chain data.</h2>
      <p>By working with the organisations who are serious about doing business that’s good for people and the planet, we are helping change happen faster.</p>
