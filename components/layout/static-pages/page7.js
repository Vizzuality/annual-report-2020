        <p>Giving people the information they need to understand what is happening now — and what could happen in the future — is an essential step in preparing for the future. Whether we use maps of water risk from Aqueduct, or tables of carbon emissions from Climate Watch, the knowledge shared on digital platforms is critical.</p>

        <p>Launched in 2020, we can use the platform’s data to see the historical change in soil carbon over time and learn which land management methods would keep the most carbon in the ground. In some places, the increase in carbon stock could be more than 20 tonnes per hectare.</p>
